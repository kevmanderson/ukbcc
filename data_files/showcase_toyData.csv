If the participant was uncertain of the type of cancer they had had, then they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to place it within the coding tree. If the cancer could not be located in the coding tree then the interviewer entered a free-text description of it. These free-text descriptions were subsequently examined by a doctor and, where possible, matched to entries in the coding tree.
